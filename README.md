### overview
This ia a spinning stash inventory app targetd for mobile use. Initially, it will document what you have with some basic descriptors (& notes). Future versions would include: detailed stash info, ability to add breeds and fiber sources, search)
  
I'm always buying duplicates and/or forgetting what I already have. I need a list of all my stuff that I can access when at fiber festivals/shops/online, and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one with a little stash problem.

Stretch goals will make this inventory searchable as well as a sort of journal of your spinning life (e.g., what's the biggest your stash has been? how much of your stash has been spun/sold/tossed/traded/given away?)

Spinners are pretty tech-y these days, but the app needs to be very intuitive and MUST be mobile friendly. I want my app to be functional, fast, clean, logical, and extensible.

Phase 1:
* List of fibers in stash with breed info (one list per user)
* Support for multiple users with authenticated sign in
* Shared breed info
* Images of breeds
* Ability to add/update/delete stash items
* Static pool of breeds (can be updated throughout project 2 by me, but users won't be able to add new breeds)

Fuure upgrades to the app:
* Phase 2: simple search (provide some canned searches)
* Phase 3: ability to add new breeds
* Phase 4: expand stash info
* Phase 5: advanced search
* Phase 6: wish lists (breeds, blends, sources, whatever)

### approach taken

7/27/17: Starting design with some rough wireframes showing basic pages and flows: sign in, filter, index, show, add, delete. Looking to implement at least 3 collections: user, breed, and stash. The breed collection will be populated via data/images returned from the Google CSE API, as well as user inputs in some later phase.
